To set up this machine learning environment, you will need Python 3. The following dependencies will also need to be installed: jupyter, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scipy, scikit-learn, and seaborn. It is recommended to do this in a virtual environment (like venv) or to use pipenv (instructions are google-able).


Install Jupyter Notebook if not already installed: conda install -c conda-forge notebook.

Once your dependencies are installed, you can start up a jupyter notebook session in the terminal using the command: jupyter notebook.
